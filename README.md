# Vanilla JavaScript DOM Challenges

> Here goes the short description of the challenge...

## BEGINNER CHALLENGES

1. Create a div (donâ€™t put it in the DOM yet).
1. Add a class of `boxy` to that div.
1. Add two paragraphs of text to that div with the text of your choosing.
1. Insert the div into the DOM just after the h1.
1. Add a third paragraph to the div after itâ€™s in the DOM.


## BEGINNER+ CHALLENGES

1. Add an unordered sublist to the last list item with three children ("one", "two", and "three").
1. Add a paragraph after the list of items with a class of `glow`.
1. Remove a card when its button is clicked.
1. Change the event listener to the following Toggle the class `glow` to the image when you click the cardâ€™s button.
1. Change the event listener to the following. Change the title of all other cards to `"Jealous ðŸ‘€"` when you click on a cardâ€™s button. (BONUS: Change the title of the card that was clicked to `"Iâ€™m the greatest!"`).


## INTERMEDIATE CHALLENGES

1. Append a button below the card-container that says `"Add more cards"` (it should have the class `btn`).
1. Create a function that generates a new card when clicked (you can copy current HTML code) and places it as the last card in the card container (BONUS: Set the query parameter of the image and the id of the image to its card number).
1. Create a function that adds cards but receives two parameters: title and description. When invoked, the function should create a new card with those parameters as the title (the h2 text) and description (the paragraph text) of the card. Create 3 new cards from the JavaScript file (i.e., upon page load)
1. Removes a card from the DOM only when a card image is clicked. (BONUS: Make it work on new cards added to the DOM.)
1. Create and insert a button that says `"Change Color Scheme"` (ensure the button has a class of `btn`) that changes the css variable `--_hue` to a random number between 0 and 360 when clicked.
